What Is It? 
A windows system tray gui tool for quick-launching pretty much anything. Programs, files, scripts, batch files, etc.

Notes: 
- Best used if added to windows startup folder. 
- Application runs in Windows system tray. 
	- Double-click to open GUI. 
	- Right-click tray icon to access context menu and launch programs. 

- The config is stored in an xml file found in %appdata%/local/. I don't recommend editing it manually. 
	- If you don't have a config a new one will be created for you on first run.
